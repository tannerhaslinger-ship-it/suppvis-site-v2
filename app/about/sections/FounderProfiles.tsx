      "That level of awareness made one thing obvious: most people have no idea if their supplements are actually doing anything. They\u2019re spending hundreds of dollars a month on faith. I was one of them.",

      'In naturopathic medicine, \u201cVis\u201d refers to the body\u2019s vital force. The biological intelligence that governs the balance between resilience and vulnerability. It\u2019s the force that either sets your limits or shatters them.',
      "That\u2019s where SuppVis gets its name. And its purpose.",
      "The deeper I get into clinical training, the more I see how wide the gap is between what science actually knows and what people can access. People are left sorting through contradictory supplement advice with no way to know what\u2019s actually working for them. SuppVis closes that gap.",
