              Tanner was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and needed to know
              exactly how every supplement affected his body. Not what a brand
              claimed. Not what an influencer promoted. What actually worked, for
              him, backed by real data.

              Connor is studying naturopathic medicine and kept seeing patients
              confused by contradictory supplement advice with no way to track
              what was actually helping.

            <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
              They built SuppVis to solve both problems. No brand affiliations
              dictating recommendations. No generic advice. Just a system that
              watches what you take, tracks how you respond, and tells you the
              truth.

              SuppVis isn&rsquo;t funded by supplement companies. It&rsquo;s built by
              two people who take supplements and got tired of guessing.
